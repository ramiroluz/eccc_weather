Requirements
------------

This is the task to be executed in python:

    Get the station list (see ftp://ftp.tor.ec.gc.ca/Pub/Get_More_Data_Plus_de_donnees/Station%20Inventory%20EN.csv)
    Get the weather information by station
    Save both in a mysql database with a relationship 1 -> N
    Make a job to update the information hourly
    Save the date of the last update in the database as well.

The relevant info is from the current day, or the first backwards until 15 days before, otherwise the data is irrelevant for the building status.

Configuration
-------------

  - Create a database.
  - Create a directory for the csv files. (mkdir csv)
  - Create a virtualenv, or activate a previous one.
  - Install the requirements inside the virtualenv.
  - Copy the env_sample to .env
    - Change the username, password and database name in the .env file.

Instructions
------------

As it is right now, to import data, it is necessary to run the stations.py script then the observations.py script.

```
$ python stations.py
$ python observations.py
```

The tables will be created, but if they already exists the data will be appended, so, if the script is ran twice it will duplicate data.

There are no foreign keys set, but the same station id is being saved on both tables. The updated column is being set on both tables.

TODO
----

The missing(not implemented) requirements are:
    Save both in a mysql database with a relationship 1 -> N
    Make a job to update the information hourly

Also, the date/time columns are not in UTC, and are being saved as text. So it would be better to localize and convert the date/time columns.

The column updated is a datetime object, but it is not a UTC time yet.
